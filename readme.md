# Steering angle errors caused by two different adversarial examples generated using the Fast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM) (which is a pure digital testing approach) directly printed out and applied in the physical-world case studies.

[demo2.mp4](demo2.mp4) shows that DeepBillboard is able to continuously deviate a car within each frame. In the video, we control the steering wheel according to the direction of a popular CNN-based steering model at each frame, by doing this we simulate the actions of a self-driving vehicle. 
 
[error1.pdf](error1.pdf) shows the per-frame steering angle error of the physical study case [case1.jpg](case1.jpg).
